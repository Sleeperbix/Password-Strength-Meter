Enter your password into the field labeled "Enter password...", and you will receive a rating below. The entropy of the password will be displayed, alongside how many characters and which character sets are present in the password.

To check for breaches, either click the "Check for Breaches" button or tick "Automatically Check" (you will require a working internet connection for this to work). You will then be told if your password has been breached.
