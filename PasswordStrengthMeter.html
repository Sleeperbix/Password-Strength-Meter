      <h2>Password Tips</h2>
      <p>
        Try and use as many <i>different character types</i> as you can in your
        passwords, <i>lowercase, uppercase, numbers and special characters</i>.
        When it comes to <i>password cracking</i>, your password is more secure
        the more different types of character are in your password.
      </p>

      <p>
        Try creating passwords with <i>at least 10 characters</i>, but the
        longer the better. Short passwords can be <i>cracked</i> within seconds,
        while long passwords are more difficult and take <i>much</i> longer to
        crack.
      </p>

      <p>
        Avoid using <i>personal information</i> in your passwords, such as your
        name, birthday, places you've lived or even your pet's name. Attackers
        can gain this information from a number of sources, including social
        media, and use it to guess your passwords.
      </p>

      <p>
        Don't use passwords that are <i>breached</i>, even if they are rated as
        strong. <i>Breached passwords</i> are among the first passwords
        attackers will use to attempt to hack you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Avoid using <i>patterns or repeating characters</i> in your passwords
        (e.g. qwerty, 123). Certain passwords such as <i>1qaz2wsx</i> may look
        strong, but are among the most breached passwords of all time.

          This tool evaluates your password based on
          <b>length, character variety, entropy, and breach status</b>.

        What is password entropy?<span class="chevron">▶</span>
      </h3>
      <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>
          Password entropy is a <b>mathematical measure</b> of password
          strength.<br />
          It calculates how many possible combinations exist based on your
          password's <b>length</b> and <b>variety of characters</b>.<br />
          For example, the password <i>test</i> has an entropy of <b>18.80</b>,
          whereas <i>t3$T</i> has an entropy of <b>26.28</b>.<br />
          While high entropy usually means a stronger password, it's not the
          only factor in a secure password.

      </h3>
      <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>
          Yes. This tool does <b>not</b> store or send your password anywhere.
          However, a <b>hashed</b> portion of it is used to check if it has been
          breached.<br />
          You can learn more about this process

        What is password hashing?<span class="chevron">▶</span>
      </h3>
      <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>
          Password hashing is a <b>one-way process</b> that converts your
          password into a scrambled string of characters.<br />
          Websites usually store <b>hashed passwords</b> instead of plain text
          passwords. When you log in, your password is hashed again and compared
          to the stored hash. If they match, you gain access.<br />
          For example, the password <i>!MaroonGravityPin32</i> might be hashed
          as:<br />
          <b
            >8482a80e4bbcf18196a173e7235990d731dcf293a00a2ad052e0a3d0bd10654f857537e961adc88fbe0ac804a7b3d5bd0a29bf3b08119740704fc680e18ec635</b

        <p>
          If your password is breached, it means it has been leaked online. This
          could be due to a data breach of a service you use, or falling victim
          to a phishing attack.<br />
          Most breached passwords are leaked in a <b>hashed format</b>, meaning
          attackers must <b>crack</b> them before using them.<br />
          If your password has been breached, <b>change it immediately</b> and
          never reuse it.

        What is password cracking?<span class="chevron">▶</span>
      </h3>
      <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>
          Password cracking is the process of converting a hashed password back
          into plain text.<br />
          Attackers do this by hashing multiple guesses and comparing them to
          the stolen hash. If they find a match, the password is cracked.
